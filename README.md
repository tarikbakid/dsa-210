#  Food Insecurity & Mental Health â€“ Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between **food insecurity** and **mental health prevalence** across different countries. Our goal is to understand whether limited access to sufficient calories is associated with increased rates of mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.

## Project Motivation

Food insecurity is a critical global issue that extends beyond nutrition, potentially affecting emotional and psychological well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic, rising food prices, and climate-related challenges have further exposed vulnerable populations to undernutrition.

This project aims to examine whether there's a **statistically significant association between food affordability and mental health outcomes**. Such analysis may inform social and healthcare policies around nutrition and mental well-being.

- **Variable:** `share_of_the_population_who_cannot_afford_sufficient_calories`
- **Granularity:** Country-level, annual data
- **Description:** Represents the proportion of people in each country who cannot afford a diet that meets minimum calorie requirements.

### 2. **Mental Health Prevalence Data**
- **Source:** WHO Global Burden of Disease Study via Kaggle
- **Variables:** Prevalence rates (in %) of:
  - Depression
  - Anxiety
  - Bipolar Disorder
  - Schizophrenia
  - Eating Disorders
- **Granularity:** Country-level, age-standardized rates
